Inspired by [reddit enhancement suite](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite) and [web search navigator](https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator/)

Features
- j/k to go up and down youtube search results
- enter/ctrl enter to open search results
- h/v/p/m/c/a to navigate home, videos, playlists, community, channels, about
- enter/ctrl enter in video to open channel

To add
- go to channel from search results
- ignore keyboard input when typing in search box
- when new search elements are loaded when you go down far enough, update to be able to go down there
- skip "shelf-thingees" when navigating youtube search
- remove previous styling when doing a new search

I won't be adding right hand side-bar recommended navigation since I have it [disabled](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid)
